    <h3>Snake Plant</h3>
    <p>Known for thriving on neglect, the snake plant is a popular choice for beginning botanists. It requires minimal care, tolerates low light conditions and infrequent watering, making it ideal for busy homeowners. Depending on the variety, the leaves can be green, white/green, or yellow/green. For best results, snake plants should be cared for in bright, indirect light. Water only when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering can lead to root rot. Reduct watering further in the winter months as snake plants become dormant. As for soil, use a well-drainging potting mix such as the ones designed for succulents. Snake plants can tolerate low light and low humidity conditions as well as infrequent watering, so it makes for a great first plant!</p>
